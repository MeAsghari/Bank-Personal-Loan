Bank Personal Loan Modelling

# Data Description:
The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.

# Domain: Banking

# Context:
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

# Objective:
The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans which means we have to build a model which will be used to predict which customer will most likely to accept the offer for personal loan, based on the specific relationship with the bank across various features given in the dataset. Here I will be using the Supervised Learning methods to predict which model is best for this problem amongst Logistic Regresssion, K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Naive Bayes Algorigthm.
